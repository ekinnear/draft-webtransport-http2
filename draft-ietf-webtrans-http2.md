--- abstract

WebTransport [OVERVIEW] is a protocol framework that enables clients
constrained by the Web security model to communicate with a remote server using
a secure multiplexed transport.  This document describes a WebTransport
protocol that is based on HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and provides support for
unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams, all multiplexed
within the same HTTP/2 connection.

# Introduction

Currently, the only mechanism in HTTP/2 for server to client communication is
server push. That is, servers can initiate unidirectional push promised streams
to clients, but clients cannot respond to them; they can only accept them or
discard them. Additionally, intermediaries along the path may have different
server push policies and may not forward push promised streams to the downstream
client. This best effort mechanism is not sufficient to reliably deliver
messages from servers to clients, limiting server to client use-cases such as
chat messages or notifications.

Several techniques have been developed to workaround these limitations: long
polling {{?RFC6202}}, WebSocket {{?RFC8441}}, and tunneling using the CONNECT
method. All of these approaches have limitations.

This document defines a mechanism for multiplexing non-HTTP data with HTTP/2 in
a manner that conforms with the WebTransport protocol requirements and semantics
[OVERVIEW].  Using the mechanism described here, multiple WebTransport
instances can be multiplexed simultaneously with regular HTTP traffic on the
same HTTP/2 connection.

## Terminology

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This document follows terminology defined in Section 1.2 of [OVERVIEW].  Note
that this document distinguishes between a WebTransport server and an HTTP/2
server.  An HTTP/2 server is the server that terminates HTTP/2 connections; a
WebTransport server is an application that accepts WebTransport sessions, which
can be accessed via an HTTP/2 server.

# Protocol Overview

WebTransport servers are identified by a pair of authority value and
path value (defined in {{!RFC3986}} Sections 3.2 and 3.3 correspondingly).

When an HTTP/2 connection is established, both the client and server have to
send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting in order to indicate that they
both support WebTransport over HTTP/2.

WebTransport sessions are initiated inside a given HTTP/2 connection by the
client, who sends an extended CONNECT request {{!RFC8441}}.  If the server
accepts the request, an WebTransport session is established.  The resulting
stream will be further referred to as a *CONNECT stream*, and its stream ID is
used to uniquely identify a given WebTransport session within the connection.
The ID of the CONNECT stream that established a given WebTransport session will
be further referred to as a *Session ID*.

After the session is established, the peers can exchange data using the
following mechanisms:

* Both client and server can create a bidirectional or unidirectional stream
  using a new HTTP/2 extension frame (WT_STREAM)
* A datagram can be sent using a new HTTP/2 extension frame WT_DATAGRAM.

A WebTransport session is terminated when the CONNECT stream that created it
is closed.

# Session Establishment

## Establishing a Transport-Capable HTTP/2 Connection

In order to indicate support for WebTransport, both the client and the server
MUST send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT value set to "1" in their SETTINGS
frame.  Endpoints MUST NOT use any WebTransport-related functionality unless
the parameter has been negotiated.

## Extended CONNECT in HTTP/2

{{!RFC8441}} defines an extended CONNECT method in Section 4, enabled by the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter.  An endpoint does not need to send
both SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL and SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT; the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting implies that an endpoint supports extended
CONNECT.

## Creating a New Session

As WebTransport sessions are established over HTTP/2, they are identified
using the `https` URI scheme {{!RFC7230}}.

In order to create a new WebTransport session, a client can send an HTTP CONNECT
request.  The `:protocol` pseudo-header field ({{!RFC8441}}) MUST be set to
`webtransport` (Section 7.1 [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]).  The `:scheme` field MUST be
`https`.  Both the `:authority` and the `:path` value MUST be set; those fields
indicate the desired WebTransport server.  An `Origin` header {{!RFC6454}} MUST
be provided within the request.

Upon receiving an extended CONNECT request with a `:protocol` field set to
`webtransport`, the HTTP/2 server can check if it
has a WebTransport server associated with the specified `:authority` and `:path`
values.  If it does not, it SHOULD reply with status code 404 (Section 6.5.4,
{{!RFC7231}}).  If it does, it MAY accept the session by replying with status
code 200.  The WebTransport server MUST verify the `Origin` header to ensure
that the specified origin is allowed to access the server in question.

From the client's perspective, a WebTransport session is established when the
client receives a 200 response.  From the server's perspective, a session is
established once it sends a 200 response.  Both endpoints MUST NOT open any
streams or send any datagrams on a given session before that session is
established.

## Limiting the Number of Simultaneous Sessions

From the flow control perspective, WebTransport sessions count against the
stream flow control just like regular HTTP requests, since they are established
via an HTTP CONNECT request.  This document does not make any effort to
introduce a separate flow control mechanism for sessions, nor to separate HTTP
requests from WebTransport data streams.  If the server needs to limit the rate
of incoming requests, it has alternative mechanisms at its disposal:

* `HTTP_STREAM_REFUSED` error code defined in [RFC7540] indicates to the
  receiving HTTP/2 stack that the request was not processed in any way.
* HTTP status code 429 indicates that the request was rejected due to rate
  limiting {{!RFC6585}}.  Unlike the previous method, this signal is directly
  propagated to the application.

# WebTransport Features

WebTransport over HTTP/2 provides the following features described in
[OVERVIEW]: unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams,
initiated by either endpoint.

Session IDs are used to demultiplex streams and datagrams belonging to different
WebTransport sessions.  On the wire, session IDs are encoded using a 31-bit
integer field.

## WT_STREAM Frame

A new HTTP/2 frame called WT_STREAM is introduced for either endpoint to
establish WebTransport streams. WT_STREAM frames can be sent on a stream in the
"idle", "reserved (local)", "open", or "half-closed (remote)" state.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-wt_stream title="WT_STREAM Frame Format"}

The WT_STREAM frame define the following fields:

   Pad Length:  An 8-bit field containing the length of the frame
      padding in units of octets.  This field is conditional (as
      signified by a "?" in the diagram) and is only present if the
      PADDED flag is set.

   Session ID:  An unsigned 31-bit integer that identifies the
      stream Connect Stream for this Web Transport stream.  The
      Session ID MUST be MUST be an open stream negotiated via the
      extended CONNECT protocol with a `:protocol` value of
      "webtransport".

The WT_STREAM frame defines the following flags:

   UNIDIRECTIONAL (0x1):  When set, the stream begins in the
      "half-closed (remote)" state at the sender, and in the
      "half-closed (local)" state at the receiver.

As with all HTTP/2 streams, WebTransport streams initiated by a client have
odd stream IDs and those initiated by a server have even stream IDs.

The recipient MUST respond with a stream error of type
WT_STREAM_ERROR if the specified WebTransport Connect Stream does not
exist, is not a stream established via extended CONNECT to use the
"webtransport" protocol, or if it is in the "closed" or "half-closed (remote)"
stream state.

## WT_DATAGRAM Frame

A new HTTP/2 frame called WT_DATAGRAM is introduced for either endpoint to
transmit a datagram. WT_DATAGRAM frames are sent with Stream Identifier 0.

{: #fig-wt_datagram title="WT_DATAGRAM Frame Format"}

The WT_DATAGRAM frame define the following fields:

   Pad Length:  An 8-bit field containing the length of the frame
      padding in units of octets.  This field is conditional (as
      signified by a "?" in the diagram) and is only present if the
      PADDED flag is set.

   Session ID:  An unsigned 31-bit integer that identifies the
      stream Connect Stream for this Web Transport stream.  The
      Session ID MUST be MUST be an open stream negotiated via the
      extended CONNECT protocol with a `:protocol` value of
      "webtransport".

   Data:  Application data.  The amount of data is the remainder of the
      frame payload after subtracting the length of the other fields
      that are present.

The WT_DATAGRAM frame does not define any flags.

The recipient MAY respond with a stream error of type WT_STREAM_ERROR if the
specified WebTransport Connect Stream does not exist, is not a stream
established via extended CONNECT to use the "webtransport" protocol, or if it is
in the "closed" or "half-closed (remote)" stream state.

The data in WT_DATAGRAM frames is not subject to flow control.  The receiver MAY
discard this data if it does not have sufficient space to buffer it.

An intermediary could forward the data in a WT_DATAGRAM frame over another
protocol, such as WebTransport over HTTP/3.  In QUIC, a datagram frame can span
at most one packet.  Because of that, the applications have to know the maximum
size of the datagram they can send.  However, when proxying the datagrams, the
hop-by-hop MTUs can vary.


# Session Termination

An WebTransport session over HTTP/2 is terminated when either endpoint closes
the stream associated with the CONNECT request that initiated the session.
Upon learning about the session being terminated, the endpoint MUST stop
sending new datagrams and reset all of the streams associated with the session.

# Transport Properties

The WebTransport framework [OVERVIEW] defines a set of optional transport
properties that clients can use to determine the presence of features which
might allow additional optimizations beyond the common set of properties
available via all WebTransport protocols. Below are details about support in
Http2Transport for those properties.

Stream Independence:

: Http2Transport does not support stream independence, as HTTP/2 inherently has
    head of line blocking.

Partial Reliability:

: Http2Transport does not support partial reliability, as HTTP/2 retransmits any
    lost data. This means that any datagrams sent via Http2Transport will be
    retransmitted regardless of the preference of the application.  The receiver
    is permitted to drop them, however, if it is unable to buffer them.

Pooling Support:

: Http2Transport supports pooling, as multiple transports using Http2Transport
    may share the same underlying HTTP/2 connection and therefore share a
    congestion controller and other transport context.

Connection Mobility:

: Http2Transport does not support connection mobility, unless an underlying
    transport protocol that supports multipath or migration, such as MPTCP
    {{?RFC7540}}, is used underneath HTTP/2 and TLS. Without such support,
    Http2Transport connections cannot survive network transitions.

# Security Considerations

WebTransport over HTTP/2 satisfies all of the security requirements imposed by
[OVERVIEW] on WebTransport protocols, thus providing a secure framework for
client-server communication in cases when the client is potentially untrusted.

WebTransport over HTTP/2 requires explicit opt-in through the use of HTTP
SETTINGS; this avoids potential protocol confusion attacks by
ensuring the HTTP/2 server explicitly supports it.  It also requires the use of
the Origin header, providing the server with the ability to deny access to
Web-based clients that do not originate from a trusted origin.

Just like HTTP traffic going over HTTP/2, WebTransport pools traffic to
different origins within a single connection.  Different origins imply different
trust domains, meaning that the implementations have to treat each transport as
potentially hostile towards others on the same connection.  One potential attack
is a resource exhaustion attack: since all of the transports share both
congestion control and flow control context, a single client aggressively using
up those resources can cause other transports to stall.  The user agent thus
SHOULD implement a fairness scheme that ensures that each transport within
connection gets a reasonable share of controlled resources; this applies both to
sending data and to opening new streams.

# IANA Considerations
